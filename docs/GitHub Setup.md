# GitHub Setup

This file is all about my process transferring my work from Apache Netbeans to GitHub

My first step was going to the internet, since I had 0 experiences with transferring files to GitHub before.
I already had an account, but that was mostly for exploring and some small projects I made over the summer.

I found [this Medium article](https://mauricemuteti2015.medium.com/how-to-upload-push-add-netbeans-java-project-to-github-d3c098922663) to be helpful, at least with the initial steps.
