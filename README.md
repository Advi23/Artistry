# _Artistry_

Welcome! **_Artistry_** is an educational and recreational app built in Java designed to promote deeper knowledge in art history. 

# Features

**_Artistry_** pulls its data from the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction), which provides in-depth tutorials on how to use it. It's a great data source for beginner developers.

   - Save and share the image
3. Mini Quiz
   - Test yourself on the selected artworks by completing a short quiz
   - Learn from your mistakes and try again
